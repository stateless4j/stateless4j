Introduction
============
Create **state machines** and lightweight state machine-based workflows **directly in java code**.

```java
StateMachineConfig<State, Trigger> phoneCallConfig = new StateMachineConfig<>();

phoneCallConfig.configure(State.OffHook)
        .permit(Trigger.CallDialed, State.Ringing);

phoneCallConfig.configure(State.Ringing)
        .permit(Trigger.HungUp, State.OffHook)
        .permit(Trigger.CallConnected, State.Connected);

// this example uses Java 8 method references
// a Java 7 example is provided in /examples
phoneCallConfig.configure(State.Connected)
        .onEntry(this::startCallTimer)
        .onExit(this::stopCallTimer)
        .permit(Trigger.LeftMessage, State.OffHook)
        .permit(Trigger.HungUp, State.OffHook)
        .permit(Trigger.PlacedOnHold, State.OnHold);

// ...

StateMachine<State, Trigger> phoneCall =
        new StateMachine<>(State.OffHook, phoneCallConfig);

phoneCall.fire(Trigger.CallDialed);
assertEquals(State.Ringing, phoneCall.getState());
```

stateless4j is a port of [stateless](https://github.com/nblumhardt/stateless) for java


Features
========
Most standard state machine constructs are supported:

* Generic support for states and triggers of any java type (numbers, strings, enums, etc.)
* Hierarchical states
* Entry/exit events for states
* Guard clauses to support conditional transitions
* User-defined actions can be executed when transitioning
* Internal transitions (not calling `onExit`/`onEntry`)
* Introspection


Some useful extensions are also provided:
* Parameterised triggers
* Reentrant states

Parallel states are not supported, but if you are looking for it, there is a fork that supports it: [ParallelStateless4j](https://gitlab.com/erasmusmc-public-health/parallelstateless4j/).


Hierarchical States
===================
In the example below, the `OnHold` state is a substate of the `Connected` state. This means that an `OnHold` call is
still connected.

```java
phoneCall.configure(State.OnHold)
    .substateOf(State.Connected)
    .permit(Trigger.TakenOffHold, State.Connected)
    .permit(Trigger.HungUp, State.OffHook)
    .permit(Trigger.PhoneHurledAgainstWall, State.PhoneDestroyed);
```

In addition to the `StateMachine.getState()` property, which will report the precise current state, an `isInState(State)`
method is provided. `isInState(State)` will take substates into account, so that if the example above was in the
`OnHold` state, `isInState(State.Connected)` would also evaluate to `true`.

Entry/Exit Events
=================
In the example, the `startCallTimer()` method will be executed when a call is connected. The `stopCallTimer()` will be
executed when call completes (by either hanging up or hurling the phone against the wall.)

The call can move between the `Connected` and `OnHold` states without the `startCallTimer(`) and `stopCallTimer()`
methods being called repeatedly because the `OnHold` state is a substate of the `Connected` state.

Entry/Exit event handlers can be supplied with a parameter of type `Transition` that describes the trigger,
source and destination states.

Action on transition
===================
It is possible to execute a user-defined action when doing a transition.
For a 'normal' or 're-entrant' transition this action will be called
without any parameters. For 'dynamic' transitions (those who compute the
target state based on trigger-given parameters) the parameters of the
trigger will be given to the action.

This action is only executed if the transition is actually taken; so if
the transition is guarded and the guard forbids a transition, then the
action is not executed.

If the transition is taken, the action will be executed between the
`onExit` handler of the current state and the `onEntry` handler of the
target state (which might be the same state in case of a re-entrant
transition.
